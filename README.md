# sagemaker-sentiment-analysis

Construct a random tree model to predict the sentiment of a movie review using the XGBoost package as it is provided to us by Amazon.
The dataset used is the IMDb dataset. It consists of movie reviews from the website imdb.com, each labeled as either 'positive', if the reviewer enjoyed the film, or 'negative' otherwise.
